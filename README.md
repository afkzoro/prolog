# Prolog

This is project Prolog. A distributed Log system.

## Motivation

I'm learning distributed systems so I decided to check out Distributed Services ewith Go By Travis Jeffery. Interesting read so far, I'm picking up many concepts like gRPC, protocol buffers etc. 

I'm making logs of stuff I pick up in CHAPTER_LOGS folder of this repository.

_This project will get a cleaner README file when its complete :)_
